<!-- Exercise: Construct an HTML document entirely using jQuery...

Start with an empty HTML document with jQuery included.
Place a second <script> tag on the page to contain your JavaScript
Use jQuery to create a new <div> tag with an id of container and append it to the body
Use jQuery to create a new <img> tag and place it inside #container
Give the img a src attribute with the URL of a funny picture
Use jQuery to change the image to be really small
Now make it really big
Now add a few more images and some text captions and use various jQuery effects to make them dance around!
Use Math.random() and position:fixed to randomize the placement of the various HTML elements on your page. Every time you hit refresh, your page should rearrange itself. window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth might come in handy. -->
