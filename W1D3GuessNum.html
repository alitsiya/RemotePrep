<!-- /* Exercise: Guess a Number

Prompt the user for an input to determine what the highest integer n should be. 
use parseInt(n) to convert it from a string to a number. As long as the result is NaN, ask them again.
Generate a random number between 1 and n.
Ask the user to guess the number. Tell them if their guess is too high or too low.
Loop until they guess correctly
Use .innerHTML to show them something fun as a reward for guessing correctly.
Show them what number was the correct number in the end.
Use a counter to let them know how many guesses it took them to get the right number. */ -->
