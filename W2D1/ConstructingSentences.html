<!-- Exercise: Constructing sentences

Write a function called string_printer, that takes a string as an argument and uses $('#output').text() 
to place it into a specific <div> on the web page. Call it multiple times with different strings from the console.
Does string_printer use a side effect or a return value?
Write a function called funny_sentence that takes a noun, an adjective, a verb, and an adverb as 
inputs, and constructs a string of html text and uses $('#output').append() to place it on the page.
Put each word argument you pass in into spans that have css rules that styles them differently to make them stand out.
Invoke funny_sentence 5 times from within a <script> tag and see the result on the page.
Extra Credit: Create a version of funny_sentence that takes no inputs, but rather constructs a funny 
sentence on its own from randomly chosen words -->
