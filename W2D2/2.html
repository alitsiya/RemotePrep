<!-- Exercise:

Place the above code into a script tag in an HTML document
Make sure there is a #target element on the page and that it has a non-zero height and width
Define CSS rules for the 'highlighted' class
Make sure everything is wired up correctly and works as you would expect
Place an image on the page that disappears when you place your mouse over a particular div#magic. Maybe this one of Margaret Hamilton.
How many different ways can you think of to accomplish that task? -->
